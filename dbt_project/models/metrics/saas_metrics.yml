# NOTE:
# dbt 1.7+ expects Semantic Layer definitions (semantic_models / measures / metrics)
# rather than the legacy `metrics:` config used in older dbt versions.
#
# We keep this file as a placeholder for Phase 3, but the semantic layer will be added
# once we finalize the marts and decide which metrics should be centrally governed.
